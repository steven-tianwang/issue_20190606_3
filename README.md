WordPress TPG Business Services Cross Site Request Forgery

WordPress TPG Business Services is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, caused by
improper validation of user-supplied input. By persuading an authenticated user to visit 
a malicious Web site, a remote attacker could send a malformed HTTP request to 
perform unauthorized actions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform 
cross-site scripting attacks, Web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities.
